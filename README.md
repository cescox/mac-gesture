## ⬇️ Download

**[Download Latest Release (DMG)](https://github.com/is-harshul/mac-gesture/releases/latest)**

### First-time setup after download:

1. Open the DMG → drag **MacGesture.app** into **Applications**
2. **Remove the quarantine flag** (required because the app is not notarized):
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/MacGesture.app
   ```
3. Open MacGesture → grant **Accessibility** permission when prompted
4. Tap your trackpad!

> Without the `xattr` step, macOS will show "the app is damaged" — this is normal for unsigned apps downloaded from the internet. You only need to do this once per version.

## What It Does

Mac Gesture maps **3-finger, 4-finger, and 5-finger trackpad taps** to configurable actions — each independently. Tap with 4 fingers to middle-click a link, 3 fingers to copy, 5 fingers to launch Spotlight. Or bind **any keyboard shortcut** you want: ⌘⇧S, ⌥F4, or whatever your apps support. Each gesture can use its own custom shortcut.

All your existing swipe, pinch, and drag gestures continue working — Mac Gesture only triggers on quick taps, not holds or swipes.

### Default Configuration

| Gesture | Default Action | Customizable? |
|---|---|---|
| **3-finger tap** | Middle Click | ✅ Yes |
| **4-finger tap** | Off | ✅ Yes |
| **5-finger tap** | Off | ✅ Yes |

### Available Actions

Each gesture can be mapped to any of these:

| Category | Actions |
|---|---|
| **Mouse** | Middle Click · Right Click |
| **Browser** | Close Tab `⌘W` · New Tab `⌘T` · Reopen Closed Tab `⇧⌘T` · Refresh `⌘R` |
| **Edit** | Copy `⌘C` · Paste `⌘V` · Undo `⌘Z` |
| **System** | Mission Control · Launchpad · Spotlight `⌘Space` |
| **Custom** | **Keyboard Shortcut** — bind any key combo (⌘⇧S, ⌥F4, etc.) to 3, 4, or 5 finger taps |
| **Off** | Disabled (gesture passes through to macOS) |

### Tap vs Swipe Detection

Mac Gesture distinguishes taps from swipes/pinches using two filters:

| Check | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Duration** | Rejects anything held too long | ≤ 120ms |
| **Movement** | Rejects if fingers drift | ≤ 3mm |

Real taps are 30–100ms with almost no movement. Swipes are 200ms+. The combination catches all taps and rejects everything else.

| Gesture | Result |
|---|---|
| Quick 3/4/5-finger tap | ✅ Fires the configured action |
| Multi-finger swipe | ❌ Ignored — passes through to macOS |
| Multi-finger pinch | ❌ Ignored — passes through to macOS |
| Long press | ❌ Ignored (exceeds tap duration) |

## Installation

### Download (Recommended)

Grab the DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/is-harshul/mac-gesture/releases/latest), open it, and drag to Applications.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/is-harshul/mac-gesture.git
cd mac-gesture
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
cp -r build/MacGesture.app /Applications/
open /Applications/MacGesture.app
```

**Requirements:** macOS 12+, Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). Optional: `brew install librsvg` for icon generation.

### Accessibility Permission

On first launch, grant Accessibility access:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → toggle MacGesture ON**

> Mac Gesture uses `CGEvent` to simulate mouse/keyboard events. It has zero network access and never collects any data.

### Open at Login

**Enabled by default (macOS 13.0+)**. MacGesture automatically registers itself to launch at login on first run. You can toggle this in the menu bar settings.

For manual setup on older systems:

`System Settings → General → Login Items → + → MacGesture`

## Configuration

Click the trackpad icon in the menu bar. You'll see three independently configurable gesture sections:

![MacGesture Popover](screenshot.png)

```

### Custom Keyboard Shortcuts

Assign **any keyboard shortcut** to 3, 4, or 5 finger taps. In the popover, select "Custom Keyboard Shortcut" for the desired gesture, then click **Click to record shortcut...** and press your key combo (⌘⇧S, ⌥F4, ⌃Space, etc.). Each finger count has its own shortcut — e.g. 3 fingers could trigger ⌘C while 4 fingers triggers ⌘⇧T.

### Tap Duration & Movement Tolerance

These settings are shared across all gesture types (3/4/5 finger):

**Tap Duration** — max time fingers can be on the trackpad:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Very fast | 80ms |
| Fast | 100ms |
| **Default** | **120ms** |
| Comfortable | 150ms |
| Relaxed | 200ms |
| Generous | 250ms |
| Very generous | 350ms |

**Movement Tolerance** — max finger drift allowed:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Strict | ~1.5mm |
| **Default** | **~3mm** |
| Loose | ~5mm |
| Very Loose | ~8mm |
| Disabled | No check |

All preferences persist across restarts.

## How It Works

### Touch Detection

Mac Gesture loads Apple's private `MultitouchSupport.framework` via `dlopen`. This provides raw touch data at ~60–100 fps, before macOS processes it into system gestures.

### Gesture Algorithm

```
When 3+ fingers land:
  → Record start time, finger count, centroid position
  → Track peak finger count + centroid drift each frame

When all fingers lift:
  → Determine gesture type from peak finger count (3, 4, or 5)
  → Look up the action for that finger count

  ✅ Fire action if ALL:
     • duration > 20ms             (not phantom)
     • duration < threshold         (default 120ms)
     • peak fingers == exactly 3/4/5 (no "passing through" counts)
     • centroid drift < tolerance    (default 3mm)
     • an action is configured for that finger count

  ❌ Reject otherwise → gesture passes through to macOS
```

### Why It Doesn't Conflict with macOS Gestures

System gestures (swipes, pinches, Mission Control) all involve sustained finger movement over 200ms+. Mac Gesture only fires on sub-120ms taps with <3mm drift. The two never overlap.

For 3-finger gestures specifically: if you use 3-finger drag in macOS, it involves holding fingers down and moving — which exceeds both the duration and movement thresholds. Quick 3-finger taps are distinct from drags.

## Debugging

```bash
/Applications/MacGesture.app/Contents/MacOS/MacGesture
```

Enable **Debug Logging** from the menu:

```
👆 4-finger touch started at (0.450, 0.520)
✅ 4-FINGER TAP! 67ms, moved 0.0042 → Middle Click
🖱️ Middle-click at (834, 502)

👆 3-finger touch started at (0.320, 0.410)
✅ 3-FINGER TAP! 54ms, moved 0.0018 → Copy  (⌘C)
⌨️ Key combo executed

👆 5-finger touch started at (0.500, 0.500)
❌ Rejected 5F: 245ms, moved 0.0031 — duration(245ms)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "The app is damaged and can't be opened" / "modified or damaged"
This is macOS quarantine — run this in Terminal, then try again:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/MacGesture.app
```

### Taps aren't detected
- Verify **Accessibility permission** is on
- **After updates/rebuilds:** toggle Accessibility OFF → ON for MacGesture (binary hash changes, macOS revokes the old grant)
- Run from Terminal, check for `✅ Device 0: started`
- Use **Restart Touch Detection** from the menu

### 3-finger tap conflicts with 3-finger drag
- Make sure you're doing a quick tap (< 120ms), not a press-and-hold
- If needed, increase **Tap Duration** to give yourself more time
- Or disable 3-finger tap and use only 4/5-finger gestures

### Swipes also trigger
- Decrease **Tap Duration** to 80–100ms
- Decrease **Movement Tolerance** to Strict (1.5mm)

### Some finger counts work but not others
- Check the menu — each gesture is configured independently
- A gesture set to "Disabled (Off)" won't fire

## CI/CD

Every push to `main` triggers [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/release.yml):

1. Runs `./release.sh` (build + DMG)
2. Creates/updates a GitHub Release with the DMG

To publish a new version: bump version in `Info.plist`, push to `main`.

## Contributing

Ideas:

- **More actions** — screenshot, do not disturb, volume mute, lock screen
- **Double-tap** — two quick taps for a different action
- **Per-gesture duration/movement** — separate thresholds for 3/4/5-finger taps
- **SwiftUI settings window**
